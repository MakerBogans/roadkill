# Roadkill Enhanced Toolhead PCB Family

The RKE family of toolhead boards are based off the roadkill board designed by xbst\_ but offers numerous improvements.

- Heater current capacity is greatly improved offering 5A of capacity on the RKE-Long board and 6A on RKE<sup>2</sup>.
- Support for simultaneous use of neopixels, filament sensor, inductive probe and x endstop switch with dedicated ports for all features.
- All boards within the RKE family are pin compatible allowing for mix and matching of boards.

## Important Notes

- Heater screw terminal is polarised, as the 24V supply is used as a common rail.
- Nylon or printed washers should be used to protect the mounting holes due to the proximity of the traces to the holes.
- LED port is designed for neopixels and uses a common 5V rail with the filament sensor port.
- Probe port has a 24V power rail derived from the heater.

&#9888;<b>Do not connect a wire between the MCU and the Roadkill probe port for V, this will result in backfeeding 24V into the MCU. V is provided from the Heater</b>

## BOM

Per Board,

- 1 x 20 pin IDC header (2x10 2.54mm pitch)
- 5 x 2 pin JST-XH
- 3 x 3 pin JST-XH (2x for RKE Long)
- 1 x 4 pin JST-XH (2X for RKE Long)
- 1 x 5 mm pitch screw terminal (TB00250002BE)

Molex temp-flex ribbon is the preferred ribbon solution (Molex, 100057-0101).

For IDC connector/sockets 3M D89120-0131HK with D3448-89120 strain relief clip are the preferred solutions.

## Pinout for Ports

IDC numbering is ODD_EVEN with 1 denoted by an arrow on the PCB

Pin 1 of the JST-XH ports is the square pads on the PCB.

For RKE<sup>2</sup>

| Port             | Pin 1 (IDC PIN)  | Pin 2 (IDC PIN) | Pin 3 (IDC PIN) | Pin 4 (IDC PIN) |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Layer Fan        | Fan Voltage (18) | Fan GND (20)    | -               | -               |
| Heater Fan       | Fan Voltage (14) | Fan GND (16)    | -               | -               |
| X endstop        | GND (2)          | Signal (12)     | -               | -               |
| Filament Sensor  | 5 V (4)          | GND (2)         | Signal (10)     | -               |
| Neopixel         | 5 V (4)          | GND (2)         | Data In (6)     | -               |
| Probe            | 24 (1,2)         | GND (2)         | Signal (8)      | -               |
| Thermistor (T0)  | T0 (11)          | GNDA (9)        | -               | -               |
| Extruder Stepper | A1 (19)          | A2 (17)         | B1 (15)         | B2 (13)         |
| Heater           | 24 V (1,3)       | HE GND (5,7)    | -               | -               |

RKE Long and RK36 utilise a combined Filament Sensor and X endstop port pinout is below.

| Port                | Pin 1 (IDC PIN) | Pin 2 (IDC PIN) | Pin 3 (IDC PIN) | Pin 4 (IDC PIN) |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Combined FS and XES | 5 V (4)         | GND (2)         | Signal (12)     | Signal (10)     |

# Wiring Harness Guide
This guide should help you crimp the cables between your MCU and gantry RKE2 PCB.
[Harness Guide](/roadkill/RKE2_harness_guide.pdf)
You can follow the voron guide for lengths here:
[Trident](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/electrical/trident_gantry_wires.html)
[2.4](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/electrical/v2_gantry_wires.html)
# Probe Wiring
It is critical to wire Z probe correctly to avoid damage to MCU. Follow the below wiring guides
RK36v2 and the RKE2PJ board have probe voltage jumpers to disconnect the probe voltage pin entirely unless correctly configured. Both 5v and 24v are selectable.
RK36 solder pad jumpers are located on the rear of the board.

# Troubleshooting

| Number | Symptoms | Cause | Solution |
|---| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | X endstop is permently triggered or not triggering | X end stop is shorted to GND on the MCU->Roadkill board, S is connected to G on the X endstop port  | Swap X endstop pins on the MCU->Roadkill board |
| 2 | Probe disconnecting when heater is turned  on, Flickering Probe during PWM control of the Probe | Reversed Polarity on the 24 V Screw terminal on the MCU->Roadkill board | Swap  Heater Wires on the MCU->Roadkill board |
